# File Manager and Shopping List API

This project combines a basic file management system with a REST API for managing a shopping list. The application is built using Node.js, leveraging its file system capabilities to store shopping list data in JSON format. It exposes CRUD operations via HTTP endpoints to manage the shopping list.
